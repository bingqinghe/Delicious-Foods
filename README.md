# Project 4: Capstone
## The final project is your opportunity to design and implement a dynamic website of your own. So long as your final project draws upon this course’s lessons, the nature of your website will be entirely up to you.

- Your web application must be sufficiently distinct from the other projects in this course (and, in addition, may not be based on the old CS50W Pizza project), and more complex than those.

- Your web application must utilize Django (including at least one model) on the back-end and JavaScript on the front-end.

- Your web application must be mobile-responsive.

- In a README.md in your project’s main directory, include a short writeup describing your project, what’s contained in each file you created, and (optionally) any other additional information the staff should know about your project. This file should also provide your justification for why you believe your project satisfies the distinctiveness and complexity requirements, mentioned above.

- If you’ve added any Python packages that need to be installed in order to run your web application, be sure to add them to a requirements.txt file!
